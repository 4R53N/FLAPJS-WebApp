## Introduction 

This is a basic tutorial to familiarize you with the working environment for flap.js. For first time users,
you will first experience our landing page which allows you go straight to the workspace or be redirected to this
tutorial. After the first use, you will always be redirected straight to the workspace.

## Getting Started

When you launch the workspace you will be redirected to workspace. The workspace consists of two tool bars that provide 
multiple functionality. Flap.js currently supports DFA and NFA functionality, but this project will have multiple 
iterations to add more functionality for it. 

Noteworthy Workspace Functionality
* **Auto-Save Functionality** - To prevent students from accidentally losing their work if they refresh their browser 
or close the window. 

* **Delete Mode** - You can drag and drop items into the outlined outer margins of the workspace, which will trigger
the red outlined dashed margins, warning you that you're about to delete something.

* **Cross Platform** - ~~You can only use JFLAP on your deskptop/laptop~~. The workspace provides the same functionality 
in both your desktop/laptop or your mobile device. We made sure that flap.js is responsive in web browsers and mobile devices.

# App
This is the entrypoint component of the entire app. The only thing higher than this is the literal "root" component with the "root" id (which is managed by `index.js`). Everything is basically connected to here.

## Motivation
You need some central place to organize app-wide communications. And cause I love all of you. <3

## Work Log
- Added layouts to the app, instead of the old throw-anything-in-that-works code blocks.
- Created App component.

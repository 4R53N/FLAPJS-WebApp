## Why remake JFLAP?
JFLAP was uncomfortable to use and not intuitive to understand. It was also lacking in accessibility and customizable features.

## VS Code vs Atom?
VS Code has better support currently. I used to be an avid Atom fan, but VS Code has temporarily won me over.

## Agile vs Waterfall?
We actually used Waterfall for our first couple quarters of development. After jumpstarting what is our core codebase, we've moved on to Agile, which I think fits our feedback-centered development cycle.

## Why React?
Legacy code. But it is still nice to work with...

## Why Jest?
It works well with React without extra other buy-in's.

## Why Storybook?
It documents, tests, AND provides an isolated dev environment for components. There is really nothing that can replace it currently.

## Why Webpack?
Webpack is designed specifically for large single page applications, such as this one, that manage a lot of assets and plugins. If we were building a library, I would have suggested Rollup due to its lighter weight.
